**Project Description:** This project currently holds the main page of our Rec Well Staff Website which is based on professional development and adding a database to hold their employee's information. This README file holds work conducted for the first sprint of the project as we focused on adding GUI of the home page. Below we have user stories, burndown charts, daily scrum meeting notes, and a review of the sprint.

**User Stories:** <br>

**User Story 1:** <br> 
As an admin, I want to utilize an employee directory for our student staff which holds their personal information such as phone numbers, email, and a biography so I can better understand who they are and how I can contact them if need.
**User Story 2:** <br> As a professional staff employee, I need to have different privledges on this website that allow me to add points and add blog posts. These are privleges that student staff will not have.
**User Story 3:** <br> As an admin, I want to be able to upload blog posts at least every month. These blog posts are created as a pdf. I want to be able to easily upload a pdf to this website.

**Burn Down Chart Day 4, Day 9, Day 12** <br>
Day 4: ![GitGraph](BurnDownChartDay4.png) 
<br>
This burn down chart does not accurately show the amount of work completed because our group did not know the graph depended on manual data entrance. We realized how to use this chart correctly after this screenshot was taken. The graph still showed us an accurate ideal burndown. We talked to the professor about this.
Day 9: ![GitGraph](Burn%20Down%20Chart%20Day%209.png)
<br>
Day 12: ![GitGraph](BurnDownChartDay12.png) <br>
Our group could not figure out how to change the current day's total work completed because the burndown website only allowed us to edit past day's total work completed. I believe this error in our graph arised from closing tasks on day 12 even though work had been completed for these tasks on other days. We estimated we worked for 2.5 hours on day 12 and that is shown with the drawn in red dot and line to thr graph.

**Sprint Review:**

**a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?** <br>
We found that it was important to communicate what tasks were being currently worked on, completed, and still needed to be finished. This was important becuase it reduced the number of potential merge errors that we anticipated getting later in the project. We also found it was important for people to work on the parts of the website and development that matched their skills the best. 
<br>
**b. What did go well? Why?** <br>
One thing we believed we well was our communication. We were contantly conmmunicating to ensure that we were meeting deadlines, staying on track for budgeted time, and keeping the project in scope. We did this best through a groupchat that we had created where we can send questions and pictures and get quick responses instead of having to wait for in person conversations.
<br>
**c. What didn’t go well? Why not?** <br>
One area we think we could improve on is time estimation. We had created time estimations for each of our major sprint goals and most of the time they were inaccurate. One of the reasons we think this happened was becasue we had over estimated our skills and knowledge retention from previous courses.
<br>
**d. How can you make things better next time?** <br>
We think we can make things better, especially our time estimations, by break down each part and goal of our project into smaller pieces. This will be valuable as it will allow us to have a better understanding of how much time we still need to spend to hit our sprint goals. It will also allow more people to simultaneously work on one part of the project if it is broken up into smaller chunks.
<br>
**e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?** <br>
We are happy with the visual design of our website. There are still a few small pieces we would like to refine, but in general we are very happy with what we have completed so far.
<br>
**f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?** <br>
Group 2 was invited to our sprint review. Some feedback we received following the sprint review was that during our sprint review, we effectively communicated evidence of the daily scrum and we were confident in our effort and unified in deciding what went well and what needs improving. We believe we are now well prepared for the next stage of the projet and will see further improvement in our future sprints. Yes, everybody was present for the sprint review.

Prototype:
After our meeting with the staff member's of Rec Well here was out initial Protype for both the Login/Sign-Up Screen and the Main Page. We were able to include the items that they needed:

![InitialPrototype:Login](InitialPrototypeLogin.png)

![InitialPrototype:Main](InitialPrototypeMain.png)

We met with them and discussed what they were looking for:
- Wanted darker color scheme
- More simple
- Scrolling and all links showing on one page

Afterwards we met as a team and sketched out a new design for the main page and the login one. We took the news ideas out and it was close to what they envisioned. They also encouraged us to do what we think best and would best fit the site and their needs. Here is the new Prototype designs:
