_We need to make a table_

Daily Scrum Meetings:
You are assumed that you have done at least 15 minutes of daily meetings throughout the
sprint. Show evidence of 3 “stand-up” Scrum meetings in your README. In your evidence, show
each team member’s responses to the following questions:
a. What did you do yesterday?
b. What are you planning to do today?
c. Any problems are you facing?

Sprint Review:
At the end of the sprint, the team will conduct a sprint review. Show evidence that the team
completed a thorough sprint review. As part of that evidence, each team needs to invite
another team for the review. In your README, answer the following questions:
a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
b. What did go well? Why?
c. What didn’t go well? Why not?
d. How can you make things better next time?
e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
