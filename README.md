**Project Description:** This project currently holds the main page of our Rec Well Staff Website which is based on professional development and adding a database to hold their employee's information. This README file holds work conducted for the first sprint of the project as we focused on adding GUI of the home page. Below we have user stories, burndown charts, daily scrum meeting notes, and a review of the sprint.

**Sprint 3** <br><br>
**User Stories:** <br><br>
**User Story 1:** <br> 
User Story 1: As an admin, I want to utilize an employee penalty point system that efficiently tracks each employees quanity of points. Also, these points will track what the point reason was, date, and can be viewed by the employee to offer consistent information in our program. <br> <br>
**User Story 2:** <br> 
User Story 2: As a student employee, I want a better way to show my appreciation for my coworkers. These shoutouts will be similar to a rewards system in which the recieving employee will see the data, reason, and who the reward was from. <br> <br> 
**User Story 3:** <br> 
User Story 3: As an admin, I want to understand how to best use this system. This will help me implement the system into our program.<br> <br>

**Evidence of 3 Daily Scrum Meetings:**
![StandUpNotes](EvidenceofStandUpsS3.png)

**Sprint Review 3:**

**a. What did you learn from doing our third sprint?** <br>
We learned about the importance of experience during our third sprint. We felt that we were able to be more accurate with predictions and work better together as time has gone on, because we now have that experience that we have gained throughout the semester. 
<br><br>
**b. What did go well? Why?** <br>
This time we felt that our time estimates were better because we had a better idea of how long things would realistically take us when we compared them to similar tasks we've had in the past. 
<br><br>
**c. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?** <br>
One area we think we could improve on is still time estimates. Even though we were a lot closer with our estimations this time around, we weren't perfect. Our reasoning is just because we don't have enough historical data and experience to account for all the factors that can impact when a college student is able to get a task done by. 
<br><br>
**d. How can you make things better next time?** <br>
We think we can make things better by continuing to gain more experience and analyzing our progress to find key takeaways. 
<br><br>
**e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?** <br>
We are happy with our overall website as we believe it looks great, works well, and we've gotten positive feedback from our customer. 
<br><br>
**f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?** <br>
Group 2 was invited to our sprint review. Some feedback we received following the sprint review was that during our sprint review, we effectively communicated evidence of the daily scrum and we were confident in our effort and unified in deciding what went well and what needs improving. Yes, everybody was present for the sprint review.

**User Stories:** <br><br>

**User Story 1:** <br> 
As an admin, I want to utilize an employee directory for our student staff which holds their personal information such as phone numbers, email, and a biography so I can better understand who they are and how I can contact them if need.<br> <br>
**User Story 2:** <br> As a professional staff employee, I need to have different privledges on this website that allow me to add points and add blog posts. These are privleges that student staff will not have.<br> <br>
**User Story 3:** <br> As an admin, I want to be able to upload blog posts at least every month. These blog posts are created as a pdf. I want to be able to easily upload a pdf to this website. <br> <br>

**Evidence of 3 Daily Scrum Meetings:**
![StandUpNotes](EvidenceofStandUpsS3.png)

**Sprint Review 2:**

**a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?**
We learned that our groups collaborate very well together. We were both very observant and able to provide constructive feedback both times. This led to our groups being very happy with our takeaways since we had a clearer picture of the areas we could improve on. 

**b. What did go well? Why?**
We still believe our communication went really well. Everyone was able to stay on the same page by consistently sending updates in our groupchat that we made. On top of that, we really capitalized on the time we had in class to work on the project when we were given it. Communication is an area that we feel we won't struggle with at all, given the methods we have set up and refined throughout the semester. 

**c. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?**
One area we think we could improve on again is time estimation. Although we knew this was an area we didn't do well during the first sprint, it was hard to improve on because we started adding increasingly more complex features to the website. Even by trying to break things down into smaller tasks, we found that when it came closer to the final version actually being complete, it was difficult. 

**d. How can you make things better next time?**
We think that going forward, we can be better by using historical evidence on top of breaking things down into smaller pieces. Now that we have a good amount of complex features on our website and we know how the timing went with those, we can factor that in to our new time estimations. 

**e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?**
For sprint two, we feel the same as we did back in sprint one overall. We are happy with the visual design of our website. There are still a few small pieces we would like to refine, but in general we are very happy with what we have completed so far.

**f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?**
Group 2 was invited to our sprint review and everyone was present. Some feedback we received following the sprint review was that our timing estimations could be better. This is an area we struggled with during our first sprint as well, so we could really focus on it more going forward. They did mention that they believed our overall communication as a team was very good and it always seemed like everyone was on the same page.

**Burn Down Chart Day 4, Day 9, Day 14** <br>
Day 4: ![GitGraph](BurnDownChartDay4.png) 
<br>
This burn down chart does not accurately show the amount of work completed because our group did not know the graph depended on manual data entrance. We realized how to use this chart correctly after this screenshot was taken. The graph still showed us an accurate ideal burndown. We talked to the professor about this.
Day 9: ![GitGraph](Burn%20Down%20Chart%20Day%209.png)
<br>
Day 14: ![GitGraph](BurnDownChartDay12.png) <br>
Our group could not figure out how to change the current day's total work completed because the burndown website only allowed us to edit past day's total work completed. I believe this error in our graph arised from closing tasks on day 12 even though work had been completed for these tasks on other days. We estimated we worked for 2.5 hours on day 12 and that is shown with the drawn in red dot and line to thr graph.

Prototype:
After our meeting with the staff member's of Rec Well here was out initial Protype for both the Login/Sign-Up Screen and the Main Page. We were able to include the items that they needed:

![InitialPrototype:Login](InitialPrototypeLogin.png)

![InitialPrototype:Main](InitialPrototypeMain.png)

We met with them and discussed what they were looking for:
- Wanted darker color scheme
- More simple
- Scrolling and all links showing on one page

Afterwards we met as a team and sketched out a new design for the main page and the login one. We took the news ideas out and it was close to what they envisioned. They also encouraged us to do what we think best and would best fit the site and their needs. Here is the new Prototype designs:
